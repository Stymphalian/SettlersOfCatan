Settlers Of Catan
Languages : C++/SDL


Goals of this project:
1) Have fun learning SDL and implementing a coolio game.
2) Create a basic framework for me to explore other graphics libraries and
	programming languages ( openGL, libpng, lua, sqlite3) 

NOTE:
The VS2013 project file won't build because the external dependencies were not
included in the github project.

Status of the Project:
In-Complete. No plans to finish, although that may change if I find some time
to finish up at the end of the school term.
