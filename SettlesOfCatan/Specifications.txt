questions?
Limits on resource?
limits on dev cards -- yes
how to facilitate trade between players?
	-Players can control how many resources the have
		they just assign a number to the number of resources they have
		A hand showing them what cards they have, or just a text box.
What happens when some of the spcial dev cards are used?
	are they recycled back into the deck?

** just show the game board and the placement of the pieces. ( seems to simple and stupid )
Shell of the game. Pieces don't really matter, this would be much simpler to code,because all it is
	are the graphics of each item. No need to keep track of how many points or any information like that
